### Installing

You may experience some problems, after installing Meteor. If some of
the code don't work right after downloading, report an
 [issue](https://github.com/ddspog/MAM-Seed/issues/new).

 If you have problems understanding the code, you can follow how this
 seed was made on this
  [tutorial](http://www.angular-meteor.com/tutorials/socially/angular1/bootstrapping).
 Further changes, not displayed there, you can see on [**Wiki**](https://github.com/ddspog/MAM-Seed/wiki)
 what were made different from the tutorial.

### Tests

You can test the application using command:
```
meteor npm test
```
All of the test running, will be found with the `tests.js` extension,
within the project.

### Deployment

I've tested deployment with this project, using [**Heroku**](https://dashboard.heroku.com/).
Using an easy-to-do
 [tutorial](http://justmeteor.com/blog/deploy-to-production-on-heroku/)
 on the internet. It basically installs
 [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/), uses an line to
 adapt this project to Heroku, and then you can push the project to
 Heroku.
